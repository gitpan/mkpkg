This code is free software; you can redistribute it or modify it under the same
terms as Perl itself.

This is a utility to create a SVR4-type 'pkgadd' distribution of Perl.  In
order to use the mkpkg script you must first apply the supplied patch
'packlist.patch' to your Perl source, rebuild and reinstall Perl.  The supplied
patch adds a new Perl module ExtUtils::Packlist, and modifies the Perl install
scripts so that they generate a packlist file for Perl itself during
installation.

The script mkpkg will scan your system for the Perl packlist, and also for the
packlists of any additional modules that you have installed.  It will then
generate all the files required by the SVR4 pkgmk utility, and run pkgmk to
build the pkgadd distribution.

During subsequent installation of the generated package, the user will be asked
if they wish to install any of the add-on modules contained in the package, and
if they want to install documentation.
